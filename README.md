# Embedded GPIO Driver Development with STM32F407G-DISC1 Board

This project contains GPIO driver development from scratch. There are three different sample applications and these applications are APIs of driver. 

Project example application codes are as follows;
  - led_toggle.c
  - led_button.c
  - button_interrupt.c

# Prerequisites

* [AC6] - AC6 is specializing on Embedded Systems Technologies.

# Installing

* Install the [AC6] software
* Start the eclipse.exe
* Set STM32F407G file as workspace
